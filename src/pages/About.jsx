          <h1>Mental health support that actually fits university life</h1>
          <p>Strathmore Mental Health was born out of a simple observation: Strathmore has the counselors, the Student Welfare office, and the will — but students weren't reaching out. Stigma, fear of being seen, and long wait times kept help out of reach.</p>
          <p>We set out to remove every barrier between a student in need and the support they deserve.</p>
